# Project 1

By: Jonathan Bravo & Yu Hong

## Usage

First you must `cd` into the project directory to compile the code. This can be
done two ways. Either in a single line using:

```erlang
erlc project1.erl
```

or inside of an erlang vm using `erl` and then once the vm is active typing:

```erlang
c(project1).
```

If you wish to _host_ a server you would start a node, but may run the
`start_server(K).` function without starting a node if you wish to mine locally
only.

To start a node you would type:

```erlang
erl -name name@server_ip
```

And then you can execute the code by typing the following in an erlang shell:

```erlang
project1:start_server(4). %4 can be replaced by the desired number of 0s
```

This will start a server that then starts a worker that then starts 10 mining
processes, so you will see see output on code execution. If you want to mine
additional coins with the input value of `K` you can type:

```erlang
mining_server ! launch_worker
```

This is the registered atom for the server you started. We would be sending
instructions to start a new worker, which in turn would start 10 more mining
processes.

If you would like to mine for coins with a different value of `K` then you must
`q().` quit out of the erlang vm and then start it again and run the
`project1:start_server(K).` function with a different value of `K`.

Workers can be started on remote machines by following the same compilation
steps as above, but the function to execute in an erlang shell is:

```erlang
project1:start_worker('name@server_ip').
```

This will start a worker and send all coins to the server.

### Special Notes On Nodes and Connections

To connect my partner and I had to use `ifconfig` to get our ip address and
then edit our `/etc/hosts` file to include it at the end as follows:

```
10.0.0.1 erlangnode
```

We also had to set up a file called an erlang cookie in our home directories
that contained the same string so that our nodes would connect as follows:

```
echo this_is_secret > ~/.erlang.cookie
```

If we both did this with the same string and then both included our ip addresses
as the erlangnode, we were able to make our erlang nodes communicate.

## Work Unit Size

On start each worker spawns 10 mining processes of their own. We tried higher
values but noticed that cpu usage actually fell. We measured this with a
combination of the `time` command and using the system monitor when mining for
coins with a `K` of 5 or larger. We were able to maximize CPU utalization at
around 8 to 10 mining processes - going with 10 because that generates more
coins.

```

These results come from just launching the server using
`project1:start_server(4).` without any additional workers.

3> erl  20.75s user 8.99s system 234% cpu 12.688 total
```

From the above we can see that:

> User time __is__ 20.75 seconds + System time __is__ 8.99 seconds = 29.74s 
>
> Real time = 12.688s
>
> Ratio = 2.344

> This was done on a macbook pro with M1 - results may differ on x86 machines

```

Without letting the code run too long we were able to find a coins that had 7
leading zeros.

## Largest Number of Working Machines

We tested with 3 machines in total - one server and two workers. Theoretically,
since the number of erlang ports is ~16,000 one could connect quite a number of
workers to the server.
